Need to retrieve pytz timezones for a list of ~1000 cities by writing Python

There is plenty of documentation on how to do this:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17910948/how-to-get-time-zone-by-passing-city-and-country
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62623062/get-time-from-city-name-using-python
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71805012/timezone-in-python-for-a-list-of-cities
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5946499/how-to-get-the-common-name-for-a-pytz-timezone-eg-est-edt-for-america-new-york

The data contains both CITY and COUNTRY, and you should use both of these to retrieve the timezone.

To complete the project, please supply the Python code as well as put all the timezones back into the spreadsheet (using the string-definition used in the Python library "pytz").
